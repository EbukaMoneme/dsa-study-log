# Data Structures and Algorithms Notes üß†

Welcome! This is my personal repository for studying and practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. I'm using this repo to track my learning progress, organize concepts, and store solutions to coding problems.

---

## üìö Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

### `data-structures/`
Explanations, examples, and implementations of common data structures:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs, etc.)
- Heaps
- Hash Tables
- Graphs
- Tries

### `patterns/`
Common algorithmic patterns and their use-cases:
- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Fast & Slow Pointers
- DFS / BFS
- Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming

### `leetcode/`
Solutions to coding problems I've attempted, with comments and explanations when possible. Problem files are named by their LeetCode number and title, like:
- `001-two-sum.js`
- `021-merge-two-sorted-lists.py`
- `104-maximum-depth-of-binary-tree.ts`

### `algorithms/`
Core algorithms implemented in Python with explanations:
- Search Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, etc.)
- Tree Traversals (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order, Level-order)
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra‚Äôs, Union-Find)
- Dynamic Programming (Memoization, Tabulation)
- Greedy Algorithms

## ‚úÖ Goals

- Reinforce my understanding of core DSA concepts.
- Practice solving real coding problems in Python.
- Track my learning progress publicly.
- Build a useful reference I can revisit and improve over time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- Python
- Git + GitHub
- Markdown

## üöß Disclaimer

This repo is a work-in-progress learning log. Some code may be rough, incomplete, or under active revision. Feedback is welcome, and feel free to use this as inspiration for your own learning!

## üìå Notes to Self

- Commit regularly to stay consistent.
- Don‚Äôt worry about perfection‚Äîfocus on learning.
- Revisit and revise old solutions to improve over time.
